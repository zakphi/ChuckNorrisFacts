## Initial thoughts on app structure

The app is pretty basic. User will be presented with a button that will generate a random fact when clicked. Under the fact, there will be a link so the user can share the fact with their friends. If the user is a registered user and logged in, they will see a button under the fact link that will let them save the fact. The user can go to their profile page and see all their saved facts.

## User Stories
When on the home screen, a user can click on a button to generate a random Chuck Norris fact. The user can share the fact with their friends. The user can create an account if they want to save the facts. The user can also unsave facts they no longer want to keep.
